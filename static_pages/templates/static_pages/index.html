                    For Ava moving to a new town, starting a new school, and
                    learning how to run a hotel already made this summer
                    one of the most exciting she could remember. Little did
                    she know however, that just around the corner, at the
                    bottom of a long, winding and ancient staircase, she
                    would discover a friendship that would cross time itself...

                    Waking alone and in the dark she knew something wasnâ€™t
                    right. This place felt cold, she felt cold. So cold
                    she felt like she might never be warm again. She had
                    to get out. Feeling her way through the empty corridors
                    she hunted for a way out, instead she found him. In the
                    darkest of places they found in each other the strength
                    and friendship to build something wonderful.
