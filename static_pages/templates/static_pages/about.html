                Holly Thomas has spent many years writing screenplays
                and short stories, and producing short films. After
                accidentally moving to Sweden, she now lives with a
                Danish viking and a three legged cat. She has always
                had an affinity for small fluffy animals, can never
                find womenâ€™s trousers with proper pockets, and devours
                books the way most people devour chocolate.
