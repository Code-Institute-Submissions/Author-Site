                    Holly Thomas has spent many years writing screenplays
                    and short stories, and producing short films. After
                    accidentally moving to Sweden, she now lives with a
                    Danish viking and a three legged cat. She has always
                    had an affinity for small fluffy animals, can never
                    find womenâ€™s trousers with proper pockets, and devours
                    books the way most people devour chocolate.
